The first task is to develop a responsive navbar that matches the design in Figma.


Next, create a carousel that covers the full width of the screen with images and text of your choice. Provide action buttons for the carousel.


Write a heading and a large paragraph as shown in Figma.


After that, generate three accordions that can expand, and add random Lorem Ipsum text inside them.


Then, create four Bootstrap cards in a Bootstrap row. Ensure that they rearrange into a column when the screen size is reduced. You can use images of your choice and also content of your choice too.


Additionally, create a Bootstrap table at the end of the page, and make sure each row includes a checkbox as depicted in the design.


Finally, design a form with fields for the first name, last name, email, password, and confirm password, in the same order as shown in Figma. Make sure the form is completely responsive.
